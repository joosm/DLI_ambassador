# DLI_ambassador project
- Based on the course material (classification model for thumbs-up/down)
- The original example has been modified to "clock reader": given an image of analog clock face, the model reads the clock 
- Each time category (i.e. 1~12) has approx 50 images for training
- You can load and test an example model in the data folder
- The summary of test results can be found in the summary file: DLI_ambassador_project_description_R1.pdf
- A short movie clip for model training: DLI_project_model_training_clip.mp4
- The jupyter notebook file has been tested on Jetson Nano docker image & JetPack 4.6.1
